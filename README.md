# Keahi Ambient Agent Service

## Overview

The **Keahi Ambient Agent Service** is a first-generation high-performance ambient agent service designed to operate seamlessly in the background while you work, learning from your activities to provide intelligent assistance and support.

## What is an Ambient Agent?

An ambient agent is an AI-powered assistant that operates continuously in the background, observing and learning from your work patterns, context, and interactions. Unlike traditional chatbots or assistants that require explicit commands, ambient agents proactively understand your needs and provide assistance when it's most valuable.

## Key Features

- **Background Operation**: Runs continuously without interrupting your workflow
- **Contextual Learning**: Adapts to your work patterns and preferences over time
- **Proactive Assistance**: Anticipates needs and provides help before you ask
- **High Performance**: Optimized for minimal resource usage and maximum responsiveness
- **Privacy-First**: Designed with user privacy and data security as core principles

## Architecture

The service is built with a modular, scalable architecture designed for rapid development and iteration:

### Core Components

- **Signal Manager Service**: Handles real-time communication and event processing
- **Screen Capture Agent**: Monitors and analyzes user interface interactions
- **Database Layer**: Firestore-based storage for client registration and room management
- **Authentication System**: Secure client validation and token management

### Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Rust for high-performance, memory-safe operations
- **Database**: Google Firestore for scalable, real-time data storage
- **Infrastructure**: Terraform for infrastructure as code
- **Communication**: WebSocket-based real-time messaging
- **Authentication**: Token-based client authentication

## Current Status: MVP Phase

This project is currently in **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** development phase, focused on:

### Primary Goals
- **Proving the Concept**: Demonstrate the value and feasibility of ambient agents
- **Rapid Iteration**: Fast development cycles to validate assumptions
- **Core Functionality**: Essential features that showcase ambient agent capabilities

### Development Philosophy
- **Move Fast**: Prioritize speed of development over perfect architecture
- **Learn by Doing**: Validate ideas through rapid prototyping
- **User-Centric**: Focus on real user needs and pain points
