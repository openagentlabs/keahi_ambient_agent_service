# Product Requirements Document: Signaling Management Service

## 1. Overview

The Signaling Management Service is a core backend component of the remote screen-sharing solution. Its primary responsibility is to provide a high-performance, reliable, and secure WebSocket server for managing signaling between agents and backend services. This service is implemented as a Rust console application and is designed for scalability and maintainability.

## 2. Goals & Objectives

- Provide a robust, high-performance WebSocket server for signaling.
- Ensure secure, authenticated, and reliable communication between clients and backend services.
- Integrate seamlessly with other system components (e.g., session management, Pub/Sub, Firestore).
- Be maintainable and extensible for future requirements.

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1. WebSocket Server
- The service must implement a WebSocket server using `tokio` and `tokio-tungstenite`.
- The server should support concurrent connections from multiple clients.
- The server must handle incoming and outgoing signaling messages efficiently.
- The server should support both broadcast and targeted message delivery.

### 3.2. Authentication & Security
- All WebSocket connections must be authenticated (e.g., via tokens or API keys).
- All communication must be encrypted (TLS support).

### 3.3. Message Handling
- Support for JSON-encoded signaling messages using `serde`.
- Handle message parsing, validation, and routing.
- Support for error handling and reporting to clients.

### 3.4. Integration
- Integrate with Firestore for session or user data as needed.
- Provide hooks or interfaces for integration with other backend services (e.g., session management, Pub/Sub).

### 3.5. Observability
- Log all connection events, errors, and significant actions.
- Provide metrics for active connections, message throughput, and error rates.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Must handle a high number of concurrent WebSocket connections with low latency.
- **Reliability:** Must recover gracefully from errors and support automatic restarts.
- **Maintainability:** Code should be modular, well-documented, and follow Rust best practices.
- **Scalability:** Should be designed to scale horizontally (multiple instances).
- Development language: Rust : Version 1.88.0
- Console application
- High prefromance web socket server 

## 5. Technical Stack

- **Language:** Rust (version 1.88.0)
- **Application Type:** Console application
- **Key Crates:**
  - `tokio` (v1.0+, features = ["full"]): Async runtime
  - `tokio-tungstenite` (v0.23.0): WebSocket support
  - `futures-util` (v0.3): Async utilities
  - `firestore` (v0.41.1): Firestore integration
  - `serde` (v1.0+, features = ["derive"]): Serialization/deserialization

## 6. Deliverables

- Source code repository with clear README and setup instructions.
- Dockerfile or deployment scripts for containerization.
- Example configuration files (e.g., for authentication, Firestore).
- Unit and integration tests for all major components.
- Documentation for API endpoints, message formats, and integration points.

## 7. Acceptance Criteria

- The server can accept and manage multiple concurrent WebSocket connections.
- All connections are authenticated and encrypted.
- The server can send and receive JSON-encoded signaling messages.
- Integration with Firestore is functional and documented.
- Logging and metrics are available for monitoring.
- All code is reviewed, tested, and documented.

## 8. Out of Scope

- UI or frontend components.
- Business logic unrelated to signaling or connection management.

## 9. Open Questions

- What authentication mechanism will be used (JWT, API key, OAuth, etc.)?
- What are the expected message formats and schemas?
- Are there specific scaling targets (e.g., number of concurrent connections)?

## Required Crates
- tokio = { version = "1.0", features = ["full"] }
- tokio-tungstenite = "0.23.0"
- futures-util = "0.3"
- firestore = "0.41.1"
- serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
